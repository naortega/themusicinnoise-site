	Oh Mary, oh holy Mother, who knows our Lord so well.<br />
	How did it feel to keep Him in your womb, so close to your heart?<br />
	Were you sad when you had birthed Him, that He had exited from your belly?<br />
	(Or) did you rejoice as you could finally hold Him in your arms?<br />
	Oh Mary, oh holy Mother, teach me how to receive your Son.
	</p>

	<p>
	Oh Mary, oh holy Mother, who accompanied our Lord in His Passion.<br />
	How did you endure the horror of seeing your Son suffer?<br />
	Yet, despite the pain that it caused in your heart, you did not look away.<br />
	What sorrow you must have felt, your baby boy lying dead in your arms.<br />
	Oh Mary, oh holy Mother, teach me how to receive your Son.
	</p>

	<p>
	Oh Mary, oh holy Mother, who had faith in the glorious resurrection of our Lord.<br />
	How great was your joy when the Good News spread like a shining light!<br />
	Your face illuminated with a smile that cannot be contained.<br />
	How wonderful did it feel, your Son on your tongue, as He returned to your belly, from whence He came?<br />
	Oh Mary, oh holy Mother, teach me how to receive your Son.
	</p>

	<p>
	Amen.
	</p>
