<p>As of lately I've been delving deeper into what is the psychedelic rock genre, looking for inspirations, and I've come across a subgenre called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoner_rock" target="_blank" >stoner rock</a>. I've mostly been listening to bands such as <a href="https://halfgrammeofsoma.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" >Half Gramme of Soma</a>, <a href="https://samsarabluesexperiment.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" >Samsara Blues Experiment</a>, and <a href="https://wetcactus.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" >Wet Cactus</a>. Because of this I've been playing around a lot with fuzz pedals and effects with it in guitarix, but I feel as though to me the genre of stoner rock is something more improvised that just lets me go with the flow.</p>

<p>Of course, the biggest issue with improvised albums is precisely that the music is improvised, but I like my direction to more complex music with multiple instruments and tracks, I don't want to just create an improvised guitar peace, so I've been working on recording both myself on the guitar with a drum machine, and hopefully I will eventually be working with synthesizers as well. So hopefully once I get this figured out I will be releasing an <i>Improv II</i> with a sound that's similar to stoner rock, at least with regards to the guitar.</p>

<p>This should not be interfering with my progress on <i>Summer</i>, in fact I still have a few songs in <i>Summer</i> that I have not completely figured out yet, and therefore may use elements of stoner rock for these songs.</p>
