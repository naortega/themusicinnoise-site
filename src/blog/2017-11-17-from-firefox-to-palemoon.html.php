<p>I'll keep this brief and to the point.</p>

<p>Recently Firefox 57 (Quantum) was released, and with it most of my favorite addons became incompatible. Because of this I have left Firefox in favor of Palemoon (a more stable project that doesn't care so much about appealing to masses). Palemoon is a Firefox fork which focuses on performance, its UI is very similar to the old Firefox UI, so it's rather familiar. Most of my older addons also work with it, either on their own (such as uBlock Origin) or with the help of Moon Tester Tool, which installs addons regardless of the target application version specified. It also has a nice dark theme for the browser as well as a community with many people who have switched from Firefox to Palemoon.</p>
