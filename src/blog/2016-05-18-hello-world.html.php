<p>Welcome to my blog. In the most recent update of my website I decided to create a blog along with all my other content. I hope to keep this blog less personal and more oriented towards technology, but we will see how things play out.</p>

<p>All my normal content will still be available on the website, I'm just adding a blog to the list.</p>
