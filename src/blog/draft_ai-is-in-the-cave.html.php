In spite of being a software developer and knowing how much of modern digital
technologies actually work under-the-hood, I'm also aware that for most people a
lot of this can seem like magic. Somehow a bunch of ones and zeros can be
transformed into a movie which is streamed over cables and even thin-air until
it reaches my tablet and is transformed to something actually recognizable on
the screen. Luckily, after years of having to explain to my elderly grandparents
how many of these technologies work, I've been blessed with an ability to make
up analogies which make these things more understandable.

When it comes to Large Language Models (LLMs, a.k.a. AI) the usual amazement and
mystification of technology reached new peaks as folks started speculating that
perhaps this is truly the point where computers can pass the Turing
Test,<sup><a href="#r1" >[1]</a></sup> and the more enthusiastic among these
would go further and say that perhaps even the machines could gain
conciousness<sup><a href="#n1" >(1)</a></sup> if they haven't already, all
ultimately raising the question of whether we've reached the point of
Singularity.<sup><a href="#r2" >[2]</a></sup>

		Some people confuse the Turing Test to be an indicator that a machine
		<em>has</em> reached conciousness, but this is a misunderstanding. The
		test merely indicates that in a blind-folded scenario a human cannot
		tell whether they are talking to another human or a machine, usually via
		a text prompt.
