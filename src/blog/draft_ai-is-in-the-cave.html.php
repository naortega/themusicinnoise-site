In spite of being a software developer and knowing how much of modern digital
technologies actually work under-the-hood, I'm also aware that for most people a
lot of this can seem like magic. Somehow a bunch of ones and zeros can be
transformed into a movie which is streamed over cables and even thin-air until
it reaches my tablet and is transformed to something actually recognizable on
the screen. Luckily, after years of having to explain to my elderly grandparents
how many of these technologies work, I've been blessed with an ability to make
up analogies which make these things more understandable.
