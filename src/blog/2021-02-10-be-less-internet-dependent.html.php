<p>Recently I was studying for an exam. Normally I do this by
downloading the material to my computer (typically PDF documents) so I
can have access to it locally. I could most definitely simply view it in
the university's web platform, but I've always found it more comfortable
to have copies of these files on my computer. It was at this point that
my brother wished to restart the router, saying he was having problems
with the internet connection, which he needed to study for his own
classes. In my case, I had not noticed any problems with the internet in
the slightest, nor any disruption to my work flow. The reason is simple:
I didn't need the internet for my work - or at least I needed it less.
Once I had downloaded the PDF documents, they were on my computer and I
could access them at any moment in time without reliance on a proper
internet connection.</p>

<p>This anecdote got me thinking about how reliant we've become on the
internet in general, especially normal computer users. We seem to be
reluctant to keep files on our computers, opting instead to rely on
foreign storage services (i.e. cloud storage) and <i>streaming</i>
alternatives. This means, however, that our use of all these nodes of
information (e.g. documents, songs, spreadsheets) depend completely on
having access to a stable internet connection.</p>

<p>Now, it is undeniable that these presents certain conveniences over
maintaining all our files on personal computers. Yet, like in any such
system, it presupposes the proper functionality of all its components.
That is, whereas to access a file on my computer I simply need to rely
on my computer working properly and (at most) a good power source, to
access files through an internet service one depends not only upon
these, but also the entire framework and infrastructure where the data
is hosted and everything in between. This, as is obvious, presents many
vulnerabilities and makes a flaw in the system - and therefore a chance
to experience a problem - ever more probable.</p>

<p>The problem, as one can imagine, is that even if we wish to avoid
such dependency (as I do), our society does not mind forcing this
dependency upon us. Rather, those who wish not to be dependent are
viewed as strange and (even) masochistic. "Why are you trying to make
your life more difficult?" one may hear. This results in all kinds of
situations where, since those in charge of choosing the method of
communication or the technologies used for a project will often choose
that which is most convenient.</p>
