<p>I haven't posted on my blog for quite a while, but there's a reason for this. As you may have noticed, the paths for my website have changed (again), this is because I've changed the underlying framework for my website to make it more manageable (instead of a jury rig). In doing so, I haven't gotten the functionality to post blog articles to work until now.</p>

<p>Now that everything's finally setup, I have quite a few topics that I'd like to write articles about, so you can look forward to that.</p>
