<p>I have recently restructured my blog so that there are now multiple sections dedicated to different topics. I have done this because I believe that my blog is too random all on its own (all in one big clump). Now there are different categories dedicated to different broad topics, each one has an RSS feed of its own. This (of course) is gonna break a lot of links, but with my website it's best just to remember the domain name and then find things from there. This is a personal website, so I feel no obligation to keep any kinds of backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>I hope this didn't inconvenience anyone, but oh well.</p>
