<p>So it would appear that the time on my previous VPS ended much
earlier than expected, which is why my website's been down for a while.
As such, I wasn't able to recover my files for the previous onion
address. So I've had to create a new one, which apparently now they're
much much longer. But since I don't expect people to be memorizing the
onion address itself, it's not that big a deal.</p>

<p>The new onion address is:
<a
	href="http://apul5cmgstkgcacgrzsz7yg7kwycbggzczzubulhnel2g5gykr7ug3yd.onion/"
	target="_blank" >
	http://apul5cmgstkgcacgrzsz7yg7kwycbggzczzubulhnel2g5gykr7ug3yd.onion/
</a></p>
