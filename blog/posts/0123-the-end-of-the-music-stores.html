<p>Recently I was discovering some music from Scott Stapp's solo career,
in particular his song "Mary's Crying"<sup><a href="#r1" >[1]</a></sup>,
and I've been searching for a place where I could purchase his music.
Unfortunately, this is not so easy nowadays. I do not have an Amazon
account, nor Google Play, nor Apple iTunes, and I wish to keep it that
way. What I've been searching for is a platform where I can purchase
music without creating an account, and receiving the actual audio files
- ideally in a lossless format like FLAC. The only platform I've found
that meets this condition would be
Bandcamp<sup><a href="#r2" >[2]</a></sup>, but this platform mostly has
<i>indie</i> artists.</p>

<p>Overall, this makes obtaining music legally (i.e. not pirating) much
more difficult for those who wish to avoid these large platforms and
having a dozen different accounts for the same thing. It's no surprise
either that, especially with the COVID situation, many physical music
stores are either closing or difficult to get to. As such, it is not
more freedom or choices that we're gaining, but rather we're losing
them. At least losing any actual meaningful choices.</p>
