<p>I love food, it's one of the most important things in my life. However, not all food is the same, and some are better than others. What's more, food, or more specifically cooking, carries with it a much more important element than just sustenance and pleasuring our taste-buds: it is the expression of our cultures and values throughout thousands of years. The diets that we have developed in older civilizations (e.g. the Mediterranean, the Middle East, India, South-East Asia, etc.) are optimized throughout millennia to adjust to our specific climates, ecosystems, and ways of life. Therefore, it is very painful to watch as we lose we lose our traditional cooking as it becomes professionalized, where instead of having home-cooked meals, we'll eat at a restaurant or buy ready-made foods.</p>

<p>For posts in my new cooking category I will attempt to collect recipes for meals that have ingredients commonly found in the Mediterranean climate (although perhaps with some exceptions). Have a nice meal!</p>
