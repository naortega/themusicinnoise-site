	Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of

<p>In this quote by Karl Marx, he explains a very troublesome element of
capitalist society: "all that is solid melts into air." This, according
to Marx, is necessitated by the bourgeoisie. This is true in that in
order to obtain profits from new markets, the bourgeoisie must find a
way to commercialize every aspect of our lives, to continuously
revolutionize them. This is, effectively, the task of the entrepreneur,
who is always looking for new markets to commercialize. This is often
thought of as a good thing, as due to the expansion of Liberalism we've
become accustomed to it, but it has very sinister consequences when left
to its own devices without any restrictions or moral direction. Perhaps
the most obvious case of the sinister nature of this trait of Capitalism
is in the emergence of dating applications/websites.</p>
