title = An Analogy for Purgatory
description = Purgatory is one of those teachings of the Holy Catholic Church that is often difficult to comprehend, not only for those outside the Church, but even for those Catholics within. I believe that, to better understand what Purgatory is, we should understand sins as injuries to our soul.
