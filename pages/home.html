<p>Welcome to my personal website, <i>The Music in Noise</i>. This is where I
post a lot of my own personal projects, as well as keeping a blog.</p>

<p>The content of my website normally consists of works relating to programming,
music, language learning, cooking, etc. I am fluent in English and Spanish,
having lived in the United States and Spain for several years. In my free time I
like to study languages. Up until now I've studied Japanese, Esperanto,
Portuguese, and most recently Latin.  I'm always looking for language partners,
so if you know any of these languages and/or are interested in learning them,
feel free to send me an e-mail; you can find my address on the <i>Contact</i>
page.</p>
