<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>I'm a Spanish-American, living in Seville, Spain. I'm fluent in English and
Spanish, with a decent proficiency in Portuguese and Esperanto. My interests
(and therefore the content of this website) are very diverse, e.g. computer
engineering, music composition, (Catholic) religion, language learning, etc.</p>

<h3>What's My Experience?</h3>
<h4>SARUS</h4>
<p><a href="http://sarus.es/" >Website</a></p>
<p>For a few years I've been helping the <i>Servicio de Asistencia Religiosa de
la Universidad de Sevilla</i> to maintain and update their website, as well
as serving as general tech support for the university chaplain. I've also led
various activities, including some Bible study sessions on the epistles of Saint
Paul the Apostle. This is also the association that gave me catechesis for my
Confirmation.</p>

<h4>Private English Lessons</h4>
<p>For a couple years now I've been giving private English
lessons to some of my neighbors, as well as in-person
conversations with people I know. I work hard to make sure that
their English improves, primarily focusing on recurring
mistakes. I've worked with children as well as adults, helping
them to attain a better degree of English fluency.</p>

<h4>DMUX</h4>
<p><a href="https://gitlab.com/CollectiveTyranny" >
	GitLab
</a></p>
<p>For a year I was working with
<a href="https://bkeys.org" >Brigham Keys</a> to develop a 3D
derby-style shooter game in C++. The project did not end up
working out, due to a variety of factors, but it remains one of
the most rigorous projects I've ever worked on in collaboration
with a team. We used modern C++, extensively exploited the
Standard Template Library, developed a complex build system
using CMake, and even had to dig up an old code base to
interface with two different libraries (Irrlicht and Bullet
Physics).</p>

<h4>Conservation Corps. Minnesota</h4>
<p><a href="https://conservationcorps.org/" >
	Website
</a></p>
<p>I worked for a summer as a youth crew member. We lived with
our crew members for the duration of the job, and worked in
various national parks and lake access points. Our work was
primarily trail construction, removal of invasive species, and
clearing of lake access points.</p>
