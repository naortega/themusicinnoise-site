<p>Welcome to my personal website, <i>The Music in Noise</i>. This is
where I post a lot of my own personal projects, as well as keeping a
blog.</p>

<p>The content of my website normally consists of works relating to
programming, music, language learning, cooking, etc. I am fluent in
English and Spanish, having lived in the United States and Spain for
several years. In my free time I like to study languages. Up until now
I've studied Japanese, Esperanto, Portuguese, and most recently Latin.
I'm always looking for language partners, so if you know any of these
languages and/or are interested in learning them, feel free to send me
an e-mail; you can find my address on the <i>Contact</i> page.</p>

<p>At the moment I am a student at the University of Seville, Spain,
where I am studying Computer Engineering. I am also a graduate of the IB
Diploma Programme of 2015, which I undertook in St. Paul, Minnesota,
United States, with higher level exams in Economics, Spanish, and
English.</p>
