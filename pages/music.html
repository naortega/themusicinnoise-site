<p>On this page you can find all my releases under the alias of <i>The
Music in Noise</i>. There's no real consistency in genre or style, it's
much more of a strange bazaar in which I publish whatever is influencing
me at the moment. Some of these albums are more elaborated and planned
while others are completely improvised.</p>

<p>You can also find my music on
