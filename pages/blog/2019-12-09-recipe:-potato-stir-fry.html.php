<p>Living independently in an apartment, I've learned to make quite a few meals out of cheap ingredients and leftovers. This was a meal that I would make to get through a lot of potatoes that I'd have lying around.</p>

<p>The tools you'll need are a large pot (to boil the potatoes in), and a wok or large pan.</p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Potatoes</li>
	<li>Onion</li>
	<li>Green Peppers</li>
	<li>Garlic</li>
	<li>Pureed Tomatoes or Soy Sauce</li>
	<li>Paprika</li>
	<li>Oregano</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
</ul>

<p>Steps:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Dice up the potatoes and put them in the pot to boil.</li>
	<li>Chop up the vegetables to your liking, and sauté them. Normally I sauté the onions and peppers first until the onions are golden, then add the garlic.</li>
	<li>When the potatoes are nice and soft (but not falling apart) strain them into a colander.</li>
	<li>Put the vegetables aside on a plate or something and begin to sauté the potatoes.</li>
	<li>When the potatoes are to your liking, add the vegetables on top and add the pureed tomato sauce or the soy sauce (whichever you prefer) and the spices.</li>
</ol>

<p>If all went well, you should now have yourself a wok-full of tasty potatoes.</p>

<p>¡Que aproveche!</p>
