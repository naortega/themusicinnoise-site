<p>Ever since before <a href="/projects/music/ice-in-the-fall/" >Ice in the Fall</a> I've been working on an album called <a href="/projects/music/summer/" >Summer</a>. It's been a long time and I haven't really put much effort into making the album, sadly. However, I have recently begun to formulate it more, revise some of the lyrics and notes, along with the songs I had planned for the album to begin with (since the summer of 2013).</p>

<p>This album has taken me quite some time, and I've released two other albums since then, but this is mostly due to the complexity and work I have been trying to put into it. Unlike my first two albums, I wanted this one to be multi-track and less experimental. However, unlike <a href="/projects/music/dreaming-in-bytes/" >Dreaming in Bytes</a>, it is not simply me making up some interesting melodies in a digital audio studio program. This added complexity is what's been making it take quite a bit of time.</p>

<p>Because most of the songs were actually written and the ideas elaborated in summer of 2013 (and others a little later) the overall style will not be anything similar to my last album, but rather a more progressive rock, acoustic, and even psychedelic rock sound, as those were the kind of styles I enjoyed listening to and playing back then. I have also released a few demos that I've recorded over the years (in truth, most of them are from 2013 and 2014) you can listen to these to get a feel for what the album will sound like.</p>

<p>Like my other albums, this one will be published on Jamendo, but for those that download from this website there will be a 'Side 2' containing cover songs, the originals of which are either under a Free Culture license or have been passed into the Public Domain. Once I figure out which songs these will be I will post the track listing for the 'Side 2' on the page for the album (and perhaps a demo).</p>
