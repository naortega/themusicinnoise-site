<p>I've decided to remove the "Summer" album which I had been working on
from my website. The audios and pages have been removed.</p>

<p>"Summer" was an album I had been working on truly since 2014 or so.
It was going to be a conceptual album about my favorite season of the
year: summer. Of course, I kept getting delayed in releasing anything,
and kept wanting to make changes, and so it was never released
(officially).</p>

<p>Recently, however, I've found a new direction I wish to go in with
regards to music, based upon an article I had read on <i>The Josias</i>
called "The Need for an Integral Approach to
Music"<sup><a href="#r1">[1]</a></sup>. This inspired me to give more
direction to my music and turn it into something that reflects either a
more immediate and worldly reality in a virtuous manner, or tries to
express a transcendental reality.</p>

<p>Not that I think anyone was truly waiting on this album to come out,
but it definitely would seem to be a very anti-climactic build-up.</p>

<p>Regardless, I'm not sure when I'll publish more music, as my creative
process is somewhat unpredictable. But I hope that this decision will
give me a little more direction.</p>
