<p>Recently I started learning Esperanto, the universal second-language. It's a constructed language made with the purpose of being used as a second-language by everyone so that everyone could talk to each other while no one country having the advantage of it being their native language. Because of this the language is very simple to learn, the grammar is extremely simple and, most of all, consistent and logical.</p>

<p>After having played with it a little I already find it quite easy to formulate sentences with it, although this is mostly due to it being very similar to romance languages. However the grammatical rules still remain simple and easy to use (such as the lack of person, gender, formality (in Japanese), and number in verb conjugation, which makes conjugation very easy to memorize).</p>

<p>Personally, I believe that Esperanto has the potential of being a great universal language (better than English which is confusing, inconsistent, and provides an advantage to the US, UK, and Australia). I believe that if the EU, Russia, and China were to join together to make this the language used for all international affairs, and then teach it in everyone's respective country(ies) then the rest of the world would be forced to follow if they do not wish to get left behind. With everyone then learning Esperanto as a second-language we would no longer have to rely on translators for international politics and affairs, making international politics more accessible as well as less intimidating and without the risk of mistranslation. It would also avoid misunderstandings due to faulty translations or translations that do not take into account the context of a country, since everyone would be speaking the same language it eliminates most of those situations.</p>

<p>Essentially, any movement that wishes to be international I believe should work in Esperanto as a way to maintaining neutrality and universality.</p>
