<p>This page contains a non-extensive list of both personal projects and
projects I have contributed to, many are software related, but others
are related to my music. Some of these projects are incomplete while
others are dead. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Music</h3>
<p>I've been playing the guitar for many years now, and I've also had
time to play around with synthesizers and drum machines.</p>

<h4><a href="/music.html" >The Music in Noise</a></h4>
<p>Yup, this website is named after my solo artist alias. This is an
ongoing project of mine in which I play with different styles and create
music. There's not really any consistency with the genre, it's really
just whatever I find entertaining at the moment.</p>

<h4><a href="https://open.lbry.com/@nortega:7?r=FnizT7ACmJrTdw6HQJxAVGgFcHGN6oFy" target="_blank" >LBRY Channel</a></h4>
<p>I upload some covers and random guitar stuff to a LBRY channel I've
got. I've even made some acoustic covers of metal songs, like "Higher"
by Creed.</p>

<h3>Software</h3>
<p>I have been interested in coding and computers for a very long time,
having used GNU/Linux as my main operating system since I was 15. I know
plenty of programming languages, but my favorites are most definitely C
and C++. You can find more of my personal projects on
<a href="https://gitlab.com/naortega" target="_blank" >my GitLab</a>.</p>

<h4><a href="https://gitlab.com/naortega/basickernel" target="_blank" >BasicKernel</a></h4>
<p>A basic kernel written for the x86 architecture. It's a small project
I'm doing to learn kernel development from the ground up, using the book
<i><a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/%7Eexr/lectures/opsys/10_11/lectures/os-dev.pdf" target="_blank" >Writing a Simple Operating System from Scratch</a></i>
as a guide.</p>

<h4><a href="https://gitlab.com/naortega/colonel" target="_blank" >Colonel</a></h4>
<p>A personal kernel project that I've been working on, my goal being to
write a kernel and bootstrap a userland in order to be able to compile
projects for the OS.</p>

<h4><a href="/decentralized.html" >Decentralized</a></h4>
<p>A collection of different free software applications that use a
decentralized networking model to communicate between clients.</p>

<h4><a href="https://notabug.org/bkeys/DMUX/" target="_blank" >DMUX</a></h4>
<p>This is a project I worked on for a year with
<a href="https://bkeys.org/" target="_blank" >Brigham Keys</a> (back
when it was still a C++ project). The aim was to create a 3D car derby
shooter game.</p>

<h4><a href="/doublesgame.html" >DoublesGame</a></h4>
<p>This really isn't a program on its own, but rather a fun little
programming game you can play while waiting for your operating system to
finish installing.</p>

<h4><a href="https://gitlab.com/naortega/Indivisible" target="_blank" >Indivisible</a></h4>
<p>This is a fun little program I wrote that generates prime numbers
using a parallelized computation algorithm, using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP" target="_blank" >OpenMP</a>
to parallelize the computations.</p>

<h4><a href="https://gitlab.com/naortega/neocomm" target="_blank" >NeoComm</a></h4>
<p>This is a small project I've been working on which aims at using DHT
networking to create a decentralized and anti-censorship alternative to
IRC.</p>

<h4><a href="https://prism-break.org/en/" target="_blank" >Prism-Break</a></h4>
<p>I contributed a few Spanish translations to this site, since I saw a
lot of it was still in English.</p>

<h4><a href="https://gitlab.com/naortega/spaceshipsim" target="_blank" >SpaceShipSim</a></h4>
<p>An educational simulation on how an object behaves in a frictionless
environment such as that of space, using the Allegro5 libraries.</p>
