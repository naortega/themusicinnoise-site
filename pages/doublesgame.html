<p>DoublesGame is not a game that you download, install, and run, per
se. Rather, it is a game that you write yourself. The idea of the game
is that it is something to do while you're installing an OS and have
time to kill (because the installer is cleaning your hard drive for
encryption, or it's downloading updated packages, or anything else,
really, we know that shit takes forever). The idea of the game is that,
using your favorite editor provided by the image by default (typically
<code>`vi'</code> or <code>`nano'</code>) you write using your favorite
language provided by the image by default (you are typically given a C
compiler, an assembler, a bash shell, and a Python interpreter, but if
your image provides something else then that's fair game) a game which
has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Query the user in an infinite loop the answer to
		<code>`2^n'</code>, where <code>`n'</code> is a variable that
		you continuously increment and starts at 1.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the wrong answer is given the user will be asked to try
		again.
	</li>
	<li>
		If <code>`0'</code> is given as an answer the game exits (since
		there are no doubles that equal 0).
	</li>
</ul>
<p>If you would like to add extra rules you may do so, in fact, it is
encouraged in order to make the game last longer.</p>

<p>This game will require that the user at least use conditionals,
loops, variables, and user I/O. There are some examples in multiple
languages in
<a href="https://gitlab.com/naortega/DoublesGame-Collection" target="_blank" >this repository</a>.</p>
