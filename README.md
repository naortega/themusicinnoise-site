# The Music in Noise (Source Code)

This is the source code for my personal website, [The Music in
Noise](https://themusicinnoise.net/). The website is statically generated in
spite of being written in PHP and is compiled with a helpful little script I
wrote, `phpsg.sh`, which compiles all the code to a static website.

## Building

Dependencies:

- Bash
- PHP
- GNU Parallel

Build using the `phpsg.sh` script.

## Licensing

All documents generated by the website are licensed [CC-BY-ND 4.0
International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/deed.en). The
source code itself is All Rights Reserved unless otherwise specified (e.g. the
build script). The main reason I publish this is so people can see _how_ I make
my website and (if they are so inspired) copy the model, _not the content_.
